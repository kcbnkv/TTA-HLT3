        <h2>POLITICAL ART CONCEPT IN THE CZECH-SLOVAK ENVIRONMENT</h2>
        <p>Establishment of the political art concept is an uncompleted process in <strong>the Czech and Slovak art theory
            scene</strong>. Comparing to the Euro-American environment, the situation is additionally complicated by the
          different position of art in society during the previous regime and takeover period. While in the years <b>1948 to
            1989</b>, the official art in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia"
            target="_blank">Czechoslovakia</a> had a political role in accordance with state policy and was immediately
          linked to politics. After1989 a radical turn takes places towards the declared artistic freedom. Although the
          general public often sees the term political art as an art of totalitarian past, this concept did not exist in
          artistic theory in the Czech Republic and Slovakia previously. In the past to describe the art in accordance with
          the communist state policy terms like socialist realism and engaged art were used. Whilst Western art of the 20th
          century shows distinctive lines of freely motivated social criticism, in environment of real socialism, the
          oppositional manifestations of art were based on other conditions, and were made in a different context</p><br>
        <p>I am focusing on a parallel examination of Czech and Slovak art. Although they are countries with different
          social developments, in the field of art I am targeting the common features which prevail over the distinctive
          ones. Many artists know each other and their works, exhibitions and art programs, many Slovak artists are also
          active in the Czech Republic. Particularly in the field of contemporary political art Czech-Slovak artistic
          contacts are mutually widespread. Distribution of individual projects under the National Key would be problematic
          in many cases, therefore I talk about both areas in parallel whilst also highlighting the specifics, as the
          proximity of the Czech and Slovak context creates a platform for comparison.</p><br>
        <p>My intention is to contribute to the review of existing, but not yet written history of contemporary political
          art in the Czech and Slovak environment. I focus on a term of two decades, which is framed by the radical change
          in the political situation in 1989. After intensive research, I observed that in the artistic and theoretical
          scene in the Czech Republic and Slovakia there are no terms associated with the words <em>political art</em>. It
          appears in other several names such as <em>engaged art, critical art, socio-critical art</em>and many more, yet
          they are used more intuitively without precise definition.</p>
